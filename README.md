# Parallel Programming

Welcome to the Parallel Programming repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring various aspects of parallel computing, including concurrent programming, distributed systems, and data analysis using parallel techniques. Below, you'll find an overview of the different components and practices included in this repository.

## Concurrent programming

In the directories "Merge_Concurrent_Algorithm" and "Bridge" we'll be using Python's `multiprocessing` library to explore techniques such as semaphores, monitors, and more. Each practice comes with detailed explanations and code examples to help you grasp the principles of concurrent programming.

## Distributed programming

The "Chat_Games" directory contains a multi-user chat application with an added twist: a multiplayer game feature! This interactive chat application lets users communicate with each other and engage in multiplayer gaming sessions. It's a practical example of distributed programming concepts in action.

## Parallel data analysis (PySpark)

In the "BiciMad_Data_Analysis" directory, we dive into the world of big data analysis using the `pyspark` library. We focus on analyzing data from the BiciMad company, applying parallel processing techniques to efficiently handle and analyze large datasets. From data loading to transformation and insights extraction, this section showcases the power of parallelism in data analysis.
